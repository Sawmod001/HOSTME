export const FAQS = [
  {
    q: `What is ${BRAND.name}?`,
    a: `${BRAND.name} is Nigeria's marketplace for discovering and booking unique spaces. From lively karaoke bars and elegant event centers to shortlet apartments, we connect you with the perfect space for every occasion.`,
  },
  {
    q: "How do I book a space?",
    a: "Browse listings, find a space you like, select your date and time and complete your booking. Capacity bookings let you reserve a slot instantly. Exclusive spaces require a request, then the host confirms availability and you pay to secure it.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is group booking?",
    a: `Group booking lets you split the cost of a venue with friends. One person starts the plan and shares the link. Each friend joins with their ${BRAND.name} account and pays their own share in Naira. The plan auto-confirms once the group fills up, or cancels with refunds if it does not by the close date. A free account is needed to start or join.`,
  },
  {
    q: "What types of spaces are available?",
    a: "We offer two categories: Venues (karaoke bars, event centers, party halls and exclusive spaces) and Housing (shortlets and apartments). Each listing clearly shows its category, pricing and available add-ons.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do payments work?",
    a: "All payments are processed securely through Paystack, Nigeria's PCI-compliant gateway. You can pay via debit card, USSD, bank transfer or QR code. Funds are only charged once the booking is confirmed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I list my own space?",
    a: "Yes! Sign up as a host, create a listing with photos, pricing and availability rules, then submit for admin review. Once approved, your space goes live for guests to discover and book.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I be both a host and a guest?",
    a: `Yes. One ${BRAND.name} account supports both sides. Sign up as a guest to book spaces first, then add the host side from your profile to start listing your own space. You can switch between them anytime.`,
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between capacity and exclusive booking?",
    a: "Capacity booking works like event tickets. You reserve a spot in a shared experience, like a karaoke session. Exclusive booking gives you full private access to a space for a specific time window, like renting an entire event center.",
  },
  {
    q: `Is ${BRAND.name} available outside Ilorin?`,
    a: "We currently operate in Ilorin, Kwara State. Expansion to other Nigerian cities is on the roadmap. Follow us for announcements about new locations.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I need to cancel a booking?",
    a: "Each listing clearly shows its cancellation policy (flexible, moderate or strict) before you book. Refunds are processed according to that policy. Contact the host directly for special circumstances or disputes.",
  },
