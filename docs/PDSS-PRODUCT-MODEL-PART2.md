# PHASE 4 — DIFFERENTIATION ANALYSIS

## 4.1 Venue Booking vs Outdoor Space Booking vs Housing Booking

These three booking types appear similar but are fundamentally different domain concepts.

### Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | Venue Booking | Outdoor Space Booking | Housing Booking |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Purpose** | Reserve space for event/gathering | Reserve outdoor area for event | Rent apartment for living |
| **Duration** | Hours (1-8 hours typical) | Hours (4-12 hours typical) | Months (1-12 months) |
| **Booking Modes** | Capacity OR Exclusive (or both) | Exclusive ONLY | Monthly rental ONLY |
| **Pricing Unit** | Per person per hour | Flat rate per period | Monthly rate |
| **Availability** | Day-of-week rules + special dates | Date-specific periods | Date range (blocked dates) |
| **Capacity Model** | Per-person with headcount | No per-person model | Max guests for property |
| **Group Booking** | YES — single payer, multiple attendees | NO — exclusive only | NO |
| **Discount Rules** | Multi-guest + multi-hour | Duration-based | Lease duration discount |
| **Viewing** | Not applicable | Not applicable | YES — separate workflow |
| **Check-in** | Token-based at venue | Token-based | Key/access handover |
| **Cancellation** | Hours before event | Hours before event | Notice period (days/weeks) |
| **Post-booking** | Review, dispute | Review, dispute | Review, dispute, tenancy management |

### Verdict: **C — Separate Bounded Contexts** (partially)

- Venue Booking and Outdoor Space Booking share the **Time Engine** and **Pricing Engine** but have different availability models, pricing formulas, and booking flows.
- Housing Booking is a completely different domain — monthly rental, lease duration, viewing workflow, tenancy management.
- **Recommendation:** Keep Venue and Outdoor Space in the same Inventory context (they share the same host), but separate their Booking flows. Housing Booking needs its own subdomain within Booking Engine.

### Specific Differences That Prevent Merging

1. **Capacity vs Exclusive:** Venue supports both; Outdoor is exclusive-only. This affects availability checking, pricing, and the booking form.
2. **Time Granularity:** Venue and Outdoor use hourly slots. Housing uses monthly periods.
3. **Viewing:** Only Housing has a viewing workflow. Venue and Outdoor don't.
4. **Pricing Formula:** Venue = rate × headcount × hours. Outdoor = flat rate × hours. Housing = monthly rate × months - discount.
5. **Group Booking:** Only Venue supports group plans. Outdoor and Housing don't.

## 4.2 Capacity Booking vs Exclusive Booking

| Dimension | Capacity Booking | Exclusive Booking |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Who books** | Individual guests | Single party |
| **Headcount** | 1-N guests | 1 (entire space) |
| **Availability check** | Slot capacity - booked >= headcount | No overlapping exclusive bookings |
| **Pricing** | rate × headcount × hours | Flat rate × hours (or rate × hours) |
| **Hold mechanism** | Soft hold (expires in 10 min) | Exclusive lock (atomic) |
| **Cancellation** | Guest or host | Guest or host |
| **Check-in** | Individual token | Group token |

### Verdict: **D — Share infrastructure, NOT domain logic**

- Both use the same Time Engine for availability checking
- Both use the same Pricing Engine (different inputs)
- Both use the same Booking State Machine (same states)
- But the **availability check logic** is fundamentally different
- And the **pricing formula** is fundamentally different

## 4.3 Venue Host vs Shortlet Host

| Dimension | Venue Host | Shortlet Host |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Listing limit** | ONE listing | MULTIPLE properties |
| **Listing type** | Venue OR Outdoor Space | Housing/Shortlet |
| **Sub-types** | None (business type = lounge, bar, etc.) | Housing Agent OR Property Owner |
| **Booking type** | Capacity + Exclusive | Monthly rental |
| **Verification** | Identity + Business (CAC) | Identity + Business OR Property Authority |
| **Availability** | Day-of-week rules + special dates | Blocked dates (available by default) |
| **Pricing** | Per person per hour | Monthly rate |
| **Calendar** | Slot-based | Date-range-based |
| **Earnings** | Per booking | Per month |
| **Dashboard** | Venue-specific | Property-specific |

### Verdict: **C — Separate Bounded Contexts**

- They share the same Provider Management context (profile, verification)
- But their Inventory, Availability, Pricing, and Booking flows are completely different
- The Host Dashboard should adapt per listing type (§59)

## 4.4 Guest Dashboard vs Host Dashboard vs Admin Dashboard

| Dimension | Guest Dashboard | Host Dashboard | Admin Dashboard |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Primary view** | My bookings | My listings + bookings | Platform overview |
| **Actions** | Pay, cancel, review | Approve, reject, manage | Review, approve, suspend |
| **Data scope** | Own bookings only | Own listings + their bookings | All data |
| **Navigation** | Bookings, Profile | Listings, Calendar, Reservations, Reviews, Earnings | Users, Listings, Verifications, Disputes, Audit |

### Verdict: **D — Share infrastructure, NOT domain logic**

- All three use DashboardLayout
- All three use sidebar navigation
- But the content, data, and actions are completely different
- Each should have its own page components and data fetching

### Failure Paths

| Step | Failure | Recovery |
|------|---------|----------|
| 6a | Soft hold creation fails (capacity taken) | Show error, retry with different slot |
| 6b | Booking creation fails (hold expired) | Create new hold |
| 6c | Slot capacity exceeded during creation | Reject booking, release hold |
| 7a | Payment initiation fails | Show error, retry |
| 7b | Booking expires before payment | Mark expired, release capacity |
